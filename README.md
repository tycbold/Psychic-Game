I believe everything needed is satisfied. The only things that I wish were a little different but couldn't quite figure out is getting a space between the commas so that the guessed letters would look like this

"f, j, e, y,"

instead of like this

"f,l,w,q,t"

Also, I couldn't quite figure out how to make sure only letters were chosen. I thought that using the key codes in an If statement would work, but it just made things worse so I gave up on it and included the "choose a letter key" instruction.
